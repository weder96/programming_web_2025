            <p class="p-title">Why Work With Silicon Valley Therapy ?</p>
            <p class="p-text-header">
              At Silicon Valley Therapy, we believe that life is about progress, not perfection.
            </p>
            <p class="p-text">
            When the demands on your time and energy are constant, the pressure to make it look like everything is ok can lead to burnout, stress, and a disconnection from your own needs.
            </p>
            <p class="p-text">
            The speed of life, coupled with the pressure to succeed, makes it easy to lose touch with what truly matters—leaving you feeling overwhelmed, hurting, and unfulfilled. Trying to “think” your way out of your pain is a short-term solution for a situation that requires deeper emotional understanding and support.
            </p>
            <p class="p-text">
